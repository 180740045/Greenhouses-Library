# GreenhouseLibrary
The Greenhouse Library is an open-source library for dynamic modelling of greenhouse climate developed in the Modelica language. The library aims at providing a modelling framework capable of simulating not only the energy flows of a greenhouse climate but also the complex interactions and energy flows relative to systems coupling the greenhouse e.g. generation and storage units. A number of platforms are available for greenhouse climate simulation, but none of them is open-source. Moreover, no platform is currently available for simulating the energy interaction of greenhouses with other systems. The goal of the Greenhouse library is to fill this gap.

For greenhouse-scale simulation, the proposed library includes the modelling of greenhouse construction elements, indoor climate, heating systems, ventilation systems and crop yield. To the end of performing system-scale simulations, the library includes performance-based models of several generation units e.g., combined heat and power (CHP) and heat pumps. The library also includes control systems for climate control (heating circuit, window's aperture, artificial illumination, etc.) and operation control of the HVAC units.
