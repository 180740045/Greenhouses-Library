This transpiration model was validated against experimental data measured in a soil-less tomato crop cultivation in Avignon in summer conditions, when the greenhouse is open, and early spring climatic conditions, when the greenhouse is kept closed and the inside air strongly confined. The evapo-condensation phenomena on the greenhouse cover, particularly important when the greenhouse is closed, are not considered in the water vapour balance. Model estimation improved from spring to summer and comparisons with previous transpiration models have shown that considering outside climate instead of inside climate as a boundary condition implied a deterioration of transpiration model performances especially when greenhouse air is confined. This deterioration is primarily due to simplifications introduced during the model derivation and model performances were satisfactory when the greenhouse air was closely coupled to outdoor conditions.},

The system is based on the use of mathematical models for estimating the absorption of irradiance, leaf photosynthesis and respiration. The model builds on a general leaf model that with a few modifications can be used for different greenhouse crops. The temperature, which was controlled according to the natural irradiance, was allowed to vary considerably more than in a standard climate. Under low light conditions, energy use was reduced because the temperature was lowered. In contrast, when irradiance is higher, the plants seem able to utilize both a higher temperature and CO2. During nighttimes the temperature was lower than in standard climate. The thermal screens were used according to a screen simulation system. The system balances the energy costs saved via isolation against the production loss caused by the decrease in irradiance. A six-month trial of the system resulted in energy savings ranging from 8\% in late spring (April–June) to 40\% in early spring (March–May). During the winters 1997–98 and 1998–99 the accumulated energy savings per season varied between 20\% and 38\% at two different locations in Denmark.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
 
Botrytis cinerea Pers.: Fr. is the causal agent of grey mould disease and is one of the most important diseases affecting tomato crops in unheated greenhouses. Ventilation is the technique used for environmental control in Mediterranean unheated greenhouses. Many growers tend to restrict nocturnal ventilation in order to increase air temperature, forgetting that humidity is a very important factor affecting plant development and most of all that high humidity is favourable to fungal disease development.  
Growers usually apply large quantities of chemical fungicides with disadvantages such as commercialization problems due to chemical residues on tomato fruits, high production costs, risk of fungicide resistance and negative environmental impacts. Nocturnal (or permanent) ventilation is an effective way to reduce high relative humidity inside greenhouses and could be a useful tool to minimise chemical use in unheated greenhouses.  
The main purpose of this research was to study the effect of nocturnal ventilation on B. cinerea occurrence in unheated tomato greenhouses and to develop a disease predictive model. Experiments were carried out at the Instituto Superior de Agronomia in Lisbon in two identical adjacent double-span greenhouses. The structural material was galvanized steel and the covering material was a three layer co-extruded film. Each greenhouse had a floor area of 182 m2, eaves height of 2.8 m and ridge height of 4.1 m; the orientation was north-south. The climate was controlled by natural ventilation, using continuous apertures located on the roof and side walls over the entire length of the greenhouses. Two different natural ventilation treatments were randomly assigned to the greenhouses. One treatment was permanent ventilation (PV), with the vents open during the day and night, while the other was classical ventilation (CV), in which the vents were open during the day and closed during the night. 
A spring tomato crop (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller), cultivar Zapata was grown directly in the soil between the end of February and the end of July in both 1998 and 2000. The growing technique was the usual for greenhouse tomatoes in Portugal. Trickle ferti-irrigation tubes were located between each two rows of plants. Climatic data were measured with three meteorological stations, one located in the centre of each greenhouse and one outside. Air dry and wet bulb temperatures were measured using a ventilated psychrometer. Soil temperatures were recorded using thermistors, the leaf temperature was measured using infrared temperature thermometers and the cover temperature was measured using a thermocouple attached directly to the inner film surface. Global and photosynthetically active (PAR) radiations, wind speed, soil moisture content and water draining from the lysimeter were also recorded. 
All data were averaged and recorded on an hourly basis using two data logger systems from Delta - T Devices. Data on the evolution of the crop, such as plant growth, leaf area, flower production, fruit production, fruit weight and yield were also recorded. The number of leaflets with lesions caused by B. cinerea were counted and removed from the greenhouse from the randomly selected groups of plants, five times in 1998 and 10 times in 2000. 
Experimental microclimate parameters recorded over the two years in the two greenhouses with different ventilation management are presented and analysed. It was shown that greenhouse air temperature was not significantly influenced by the night ventilation management. On the contrary, a significant reduction of air humidity occurred in the nocturnally ventilated greenhouse, even with unfavourable outside conditions that occurred during the spring of 2000.  
A dynamic climate model was tested, modified step by step, parameterised and validated for the conditions which occurred during this research. The modifications were mainly related with the crop and the soil characteristics, the heat transfer coefficients and the ventilation sub-models. The good agreement between the predicted and measured data showed that the revised model can be used to estimate the greenhouse climate conditions, based on the weather conditions and on the greenhouse-crop system characteristics. Also, it was shown that the modifications to the original model improved its performance.  
Nocturnal or permanent ventilation was shown to have a great contribution to reducing disease severity on tomato leaves caused by B. cinerea, in both years of the experiments. It was shown that nocturnal ventilation management is an environmental control technique which can be used as a prophylactic control measure, since it reduces the severity of B. cinerea on tomato crops grown in unheated greenhouses. This is a very important result since it permits a reduction in chemical use lowering both production costs and environmental impacts.  
A model that predicts grey mould severity caused by B. cinerea on tomatoes grown in unheated greenhouses was developed as a function of the time duration with air temperature and relative humidity within certain ranges. This model was validated, and comparison between predicted and observed disease data showed good agreement. Integration of the climate and the Botrytis models was tested and reasonable results were obtained, showing that integration of both models is possible. This combination permits the prediction of when the climate conditions would be favourable for disease development and what would be the expected grey mould severity. A warning system, defining disease risk levels based on disease severity was developed and could be a useful tool for technicians, advisors and growers, helping them to decide what are the adequate actions and the correct timing to avoid favourable conditions for disease development. A more practical and immediately implementable application was presented, defining disease risk levels based on the number of hours per day with relative humidity higher than 90\%, which is a useful tool for growers, helping them to identify the risk of disease occurrence and making it possible to act in order to reverse or to avoid disease favourable conditions.},

To achieve environmental conditions favorable for plant growth, greenhouses are designed with various components, structural shapes, and numerous types of glazing materials. They are operated differently according to each condition. To improve the pedagogy and the understanding of the complexity and dynamic behavior of greenhouse environments with different configurations, an interactive, dynamic greenhouse environment simulator was developed. The greenhouse environment model, based on energy and mass balance principles, was implemented in a web-based interactive application that allowed for the selection of the greenhouse design, weather conditions, and operational strategies. The greenhouse environment simulator was designed to be used as an educational tool for demonstrating the physics of greenhouse systems and environmental control principles. Several scenarios were simulated to demonstrate how a specific greenhouse design would respond environmentally for several climate conditions (four seasons of four geographical locations), and to demonstrate what systems would be required to achieve the desired environmental conditions. The greenhouse environment simulator produced realistic approximations of the dynamic behavior of greenhouse environments with different design configurations for 28-h simulation periods.},

It is necessary to evaluate the climate dynamics inside the greenhouse during varying climatological conditions. A greenhouse climate model was developed to optimise cover properties and ventilation rate as main parameters, calculating only three state variables: average greenhouse air temperature TAir, average greenhouse air water vapour pressure (expressed as air water vapour pressure deficit DAir), and average canopy temperature TCan. Solar radiation distribution, air exchange by ventilation, and crop transpiration constituted the backbones of the model. The climate outdoor and inside the test greenhouses with crops having leaf area index from 0.02 to 4.10 were measured for one growing season. Measurements and calculations of TAir and DAir agreed satisfactorily, with less than 5\% errors.

The objective of this study was to explore alternatives to the existing Venlo-type greenhouse climate control policy under Chinese subtropical climate conditions, through simulation analysis using the Greenhouse Process (KASPRO) model. Experiments were carried out in a Dutch Venlo-type glasshouse on a farm in Shanghai (31·3°N, 121·4°E), to collect climate and crop data to validate the model. The results show that using outside hourly weather data as inputs, the KASPRO model generally gives satisfactory predictions of greenhouse air temperature and humidity, and of canopy transpiration rate under both summer and winter climate conditions for subtropical China. After the model validation, scenario studies were carried out to investigate the possible responses of crop biomass production and energy consumption to different nighttime and daytime air temperature set points and canopy size based on leaf area index (LAI), under the winter climate conditions typical of subtropical China. The scenario analysis shows that, during winter, the highest biomass production is achieved when the daily mean air temperature in the greenhouse is 19·7°C, which is realised when day and night air temperature set points are 23 and 18°C, respectively. The highest energy use efficiency for biomass production is achieved when daily mean air temperature in the greenhouse is 18°C, which is realised by setting the set points of air temperature at 19 and 15°C, respectively. During winter, crop biomass production reaches the maximum at a LAI of 3. The energy consumption increases with the canopy LAI. It is concluded that both from the biomass production and energy saving point of view, an air temperature set point of 19°C for daytime and 15°C for nighttime and a canopy LAI of 2–3 provides the most energy-efficient conditions for greenhouse cucumber crop production under the winter climate conditions in subtropical China.},

Total dry matter accumulation is based on a quantitative description of the carbon balance, including gross CO2 assimilation, maintenance respiration and growth respiration. Partitioning of dry matter increase over the various organs is governed by their relative sink strengh, defined on the basis of a genetically determined ‘potential’ growth rate, achieved under non-limiting carbohydrate supply. The model is both schematic and modular in set-up. This means it can be adapted easily and most of its subroutines can be replaced easily by others if better descriptions become available.

A simulation model, TOMSIM, was developed, using existing explanatory crop growth models for tomato, and validated.\&lt;p\&gt;Sink demand, influenced by fruit pruning (retaining two to seven fruits per truss), did not influence dry matter production per unit of intercepted radiation. Measurements in daylit phytotron compartments showed an increase in crop photosynthesis with 17\%, when C0 \&lt;sub\&gt;\&lt;font size="-2"\&gt;2\&lt;/font\&gt;\&lt;/sub\&gt; concentration increased from 500 to 900 μmol mol \&lt;sup\&gt;\&lt;font size="-2"\&gt;-1\&lt;/font\&gt;\&lt;/SUP\&gt;. Based on periodic destructive measurements in 12 experiments, a crop efficiency of 2.5 g dry matter MJ \&lt;sup\&gt;\&lt;font size="-2"\&gt;-1\&lt;/font\&gt;\&lt;/SUP\&gt;PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) was observed. At the end of most experiments, 54-60\% of total dry matter produced was partitioned into the fruits and the ratio between produced leaf and stem dry weight was 7:3. For late autumn plantings, only 35-38\% was partitioned into the fruits, owing to poor fruit set. From first harvest onwards, an (almost) constant partitioning existed: 70\% of dry matter was distributed to the fruits, when the number of fruits per truss was seven.\&lt;p\&gt;Dry matter partitioning was strongly influenced by the number of fruits on the plant. Generative sink strength appeared to be proportional to the number of fruits per truss (two to seven fruits per truss). Temperature (18-24°C) and assimilate supply (varied by plant density, 1.6-3.1 plants m \&lt;sup\&gt;\&lt;font size="-2"\&gt;-2\&lt;/font\&gt;\&lt;/SUP\&gt;) had no direct influence on dry matter partitioning. In double-shoot plants, where either all trusses were removed from one shoot or every other truss was removed from both shoots at anthesis, dry matter partitioning was the same, supporting the assumption of one common assimilate pool, i.e. no influence of phloern transport resistance on partitioning.\&lt;p\&gt;In TOMSIM, potential crop growth rate is simulated, based on leaf photosynthesis rate, crop light interception, maintenance respiration rate (R \&lt;sub\&gt;\&lt;font size="-2"\&gt;m\&lt;/font\&gt;\&lt;/sub\&gt; ) and conversion efficiency from carbohydrates to structural dry matter. The canopy is assumed to be composed of leaves with identical photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics. Dry matter partitioning is simulated based on the sink strengths of the plant organs, where sink strength of an organ is described by its potential growth rate. The model was validated thoroughly, both at the level of submodels and as a whole, using independent experimental data as well as measurements on commercially grown crops. In general, model predictions agreed well with the measurements. Simulated crop growth appeared to be very sensitive to LAI simulation, especially at low LAI. At low light intensity and/or high crop biomass, crop growth rate was underestimated, most likely as a result of overestimation of R \&lt;sub\&gt;\&lt;font size="-2"\&gt;m\&lt;/font\&gt;\&lt;/sub\&gt; under these conditions. Simulation results improved, when R \&lt;sub\&gt;\&lt;font size="-2"\&gt;m\&lt;/font\&gt;\&lt;/sub\&gt; was related to crop metabolic activity, described by crop relative growth rate. The simulation of specific leaf area, flower and/or fruit abortion and R \&lt;sub\&gt;\&lt;font size="-2"\&gt;m\&lt;/font\&gt;\&lt;/sub\&gt; requires more investigation. The possibility of generalisation of the model to other (greenhouse) crops, and the possible applications of the model in supporting grower's decisions, in research and in education are discussed.},

The calibrated model predicts quite well the main observations associated with severe nitrogen stress: reduced growth, fast depletion of nitrate, gradual reduction of reduced-N content, and considerable increase of dry matter content. After being deprived of nitrate for 21 days, stressed plants are five to ten times smaller than unstressed plants, and their dry matter content is two to three times higher than normal.

Most models for prediction of harvest date (timing of production) are descriptive. For DM production many descriptive and explanatory models have been developed. Most explanatory models are photosynthesis-based models. Important components of photosynthesis-based models are leaf area development, light interception, photosynthesis and respiration. Leaf area is predominantly simulated as a function of plant developmental stage or of simulated leaf dry weight. Crop photosynthesis can be calculated as a function of intercepted radiation or more accurately by considering radiation absorption of different leaf layers in combination with a submodel for leaf photosynthesis. In most crop growth models respiration is subdivided into two components: growth and maintenance. There is reasonable consensus concerning the simulation of growth respiration, but the simulation of maintenance respiration is still an area of great uncertainty, which is especially important for large crops grown under winter conditions at relatively high greenhouse temperatures. DM partitioning can be simulated by descriptive allometry, functional equilibrium or sink regulation. The most suitable approach depends on the type of crop studied and the aim of the model. As opposed to most agricultural crops, the DM content of the harvestable product is of great importance to the yield of most horticultural crops. More attention should be paid to the simulation of DM content. It is concluded that the strong features of explanatory crop growth models are the simulation of light interception and gross photosynthesis, while the weak features are the simulation of leaf area development, maintenance respiration, organ abortion, DM content and product quality.},

	abstract = {The recent development of new and innovative home battery systems has been seen by many as a catalyst for a solar energy revolution, and has created high expectations in the sector. Many observers have predicted an uptake of combined PV/battery units which could ultimately disconnect from the grid and lead to autonomous homes or micro-grids. However, most of the comments in social media, blogs or press articles lack proper cost evaluation and realistic simulations. We aim to bridge this gap by simulating self-consumption in various EU countries, for various household profiles, with or without battery. Results indicate that (1) self-consumption is a non-linear, almost asymptotic function of PV and battery sizes. Achieving 100\% self-consumption (i.e. allowing for full off-grid operation) is not realistic for the studied countries without excessively oversizing the PV system and/or the battery; (2) although falling fast, the cost of domestic Li-Ion storage is most likely still too high for a large-scale market uptake in Europe; (3) home battery profitability and future uptake depend mainly on the indirect subsidies for self-consumption provided by the structure of retail prices; (4) the self-sufficiency rate varies widely between households. For a given household, the volume of self-consumption cannot be predicted in a deterministic way. Along with these results, this study also provides a database of synthetic household profiles, a simulation tool for the prediction of self-consumption and a method for the optimal sizing of such systems.},

Centralised cogeneration plants connected to district heat networks are fundamental element of this coupling.
Despite the efficiency benefits, the effects of introducing combined generation to the power system are sometimes adverse. Reduced flexibility caused by contractual obligations to deliver heat may not always facilitate the penetration of renewable energy in the energy system. Thermal storage is acknowledged as a solution to the above.
This work investigates the optimal operation of cogeneration plants combined with thermal storage. To do so, a combined heat and power (CHP) plant model is formulated and incorporated into Dispa-SET, a JRC in-house unit commitment and dispatch model. The cogeneration model sets technical feasible operational regions for different heat uses defined by temperature requirements.
Different energy system scenarios are used to assess the implications of the heating–electricity coupling to the flexibility of the power system and to the achievement of the decarbonisation goals in an existing non interconnected power system where CHP plants provide heating and electricity to nearby energy dense areas.
The analysis indicates that the utilisation of CHP plants contributes to improve the overall system efficiency and reduce total cost of the system. In addition, the incorporation of thermal storage increases the penetration of renewable energy in the system.},

	abstract = {An air exchange rate model of a Mediterranean greenhouse with ridge and side openings combining temperature and wind effects as driving forces of the natural ventilation was developed and tested on experimental data. It is shown that both effects are dependent on the total area of openings, but the temperature effect depends also on the ratio of ridge to side openings. The wind effect is related to a global wind effect coefficient, relative to the whole building, which includes both static and turbulent transfers. As far as it concerns the combination of the temperature and wind induced fluxes, it is shown that the vectorial sum of these fluxes, gives a better fit of the experimental data than their addition. The relative importance of the thermal buoyancy and wind forces depends on the ratio between wind velocity and the root of the inside-outside temperature difference (u/√ΔT). In our experimental conditions the wind effect predominates on the chimney effect when this ratio u/√ΔT becomes greater than 1. The use of the reduced ventilation flux (per unit of ventilator opening area and wind speed) shows that for typical conditions of temperature difference (= 5 K) the roof and side ventilation system is much more efficient than roof ventilation only for wind velocities smaller than 2.5 ms-1. Finally, a simple design procedure for dimensioning the area of the vents under extreme climatic conditions is proposed and a relative nomograph is given.},

Greenhouses also have important economical potential in Turkey’s agricultural sector. In addition to solar energy gain, greenhouses should be heated during nights and cold days. In order to establish optimum growth conditions in greenhouses, renewable energy sources should be utilized as much as possible. It is expected that effective use of heat pumps with a suitable technology in the modern greenhouses will play a leading role in Turkey in the foreseeable future. The main objective of the present study is to investigate to the performance characteristics of a solar assisted ground-source heat pump greenhouse heating system (SAGSHPGHS) with a 50m vertical 1 × 1/4in. nominal diameter U-bend ground heat exchanger using exergy analysis method. This system was designed and constructed in Solar Energy Institute of Ege University, Izmir, Turkey. The exergy transports between the components and the destructions in each of the components of the SAGSHPGHS are determined for the average measured parameters obtained from the experimental results. Exergetic efficiencies of the system components are determined in an attempt to assess their individual performances and the potential for improvements is also presented. The heating coefficient of performances of the ground-source heat pump unit and the overall system are obtained to be 2.64 and 2.38, respectively, while the exergetic efficiency of the overall system is found to be 67.7\%.},

	abstract = {This study deals with the characterization and analysis of the components of solar radiation under a highly diffusing cover material. Measurements of outside and inside global (Go and Gi, respectively) and diffuse (Do and Di, respectively) radiation were carried out over the course of several years (2000–2004) under a plastic greenhouse. It was shown that the cover diffusive properties can be characterized in situ through sound physically-based parameters. We suggested the use of two specific greenhouse transmittances (direct-to-direct, τb-b, and direct-to-diffuse, τb-d, transmittances), or alternatively, the use of greenhouse diffuse ratio (ρ=Di/Do) and its derivate, the enrichment coefficient (ɛ). The transmittances were primarily dependent on the diffusive properties of the cover, with a seasonal modulation due to the influence of the beam incidence angle. We found that τb-d was significantly less sensitive to the incidence angle than τb-b. Our results also evidenced that extrinsic factors, such as condensation events and dust deposition, might have significant non-permanent effects on both τb-b and τb-d during some periods of the year. Finally, we proposed a straightforward means to obtain a quantitative estimate of the amount of inside diffuse radiation through the relationship (power function) between ρ and the outside diffuse-to-global fraction, fo. Importantly, the value of the exponent of the power function could be used to characterize and quantify the diffusive power of greenhouse cover materials. Overall, the results stressed the significant impact of the cover diffusive properties on inside solar radiation partitioning, as well as the need to account for these changes in models aimed to estimate the direct and diffuse components, canopy radiation interception and yield in greenhouse agrosystems.},

The calculations were performed using a dynamic physical simulation model with a single- and a double-layer greenhouse under Dutch weather conditions. The comparison was made based on the energy consumption and the costs. The methods with a cold surface or an absorbing hygroscopic material are less attractive than the conventional method, mainly because of the high investment costs. Dehumidification by forced ventilation with a heat exchanger can be competitive. The success of this system depends on the efficiency of the system in terms of energy consumption and the effectiveness of the heat exchanger.},

	abstract = {A satisfactory model which permits a description of the thermal behaviour of a greenhouse, is a useful tool for the optimisation of greenhouse components and installations. To date, two types of model have been developed: some very simple models of low precision, and some precise dynamic models unsuitable for use over long periods and too complex to be practical in use. This paper aims to describe a new intermediate method of precise and easy application, and consists of a presentation and experimental proof of the method. The model named HORTICERN is based on a static study of the thermal energy balance. Calculation of the net energy consumption is as follows: gross thermal requirement is determined from the parameters concerning climate, greenhouse and conditions of use; then the contribution of useful solar energy to the total thermal need is calculated. Net needs are obtained by deducting the useful solar contribution from gross thermal needs. Total consumption is finally given by dividing net needs by the heating system efficiency. Each stage of the work was the subject of a theoretical study and was then checked with measurements made at the trial greenhouse of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). The main results are summarised as follows. For a precise evaluation of the thermal needs, it is necessary to take into account the combined effect of wind and radiative losses to the sky. The new theory developed brings a new understanding of sky temperature influence and measurements at CERN confirm its validity. The solar contribution covers an important fraction of the total thermal needs (between 30 and 40\% over the year in Geneva). The fraction of solar energy collected which is used for heating is determined experimentally as a function of the ratio of collected energy to daytime thermal needs. This new method takes plant evapotranspiration directly into consideration. It may be applied on a daily, monthly or seasonal basis and is versatile in being applicable to any type of greenhouse or climate. HORTICERN has been checked systematically by two complementary approaches. (1) The values predicted by the model have been compared with the measurements in CERN's greenhouse. The error in annual energy consumption is less than 10\%, if wind and apparent sky temperatures are taken into account. (2) HORTICERN is compared with several dynamic models; its precision is comparable with that of more complex dynamic models. The difference is on average less than 5\% and is not affected by the type of glazing used (single glazing, Hortiplus, double glazing). In view of its precision and ease of use over long periods, HORTICERN is a very powerful tool for energy and optimisation studies. The software available for computer use allows numerous applications for research workers, greenhouse designers or horticultural advisers: it allows a better understanding of the physical phenomena whilst permitting economic studies, heating system power calculation, climate control strategy or the generalisation of a specific experiment.},

The authors model the subsystems involved in successful greenhouse control using different techniques and show how the models obtained can be exploited for simulation or control design; they suggest ideas for the development of physical and/or black-box models for this purpose.Strategies for the control of climate- and irrigation-related variables are brought forward. The uses of PID control and feedforward compensators, both widely used in commercial tools, are summarized. The benefits of advanced control techniques—event-based, robust, and predictive control, for example—are used to improve on the performance of those basic methods.A hierarchical control architecture is developed governed by a high-level multiobjective optimization approach rather than traditional constrained optimization and artificial intelligence techniques. Reference trajectories are found for diurnal and nocturnal temperatures (climate-related setpoints) and electrical conductivity (fertirrigation-related setpoints). The objectives are to maximize profit, fruit quality, and water-use efficiency, these being encouraged by current international rules. Illustrative practical results selected from those obtained in an industrial greenhouse during the last eight years are shown and described. The text of the book is complemented by the use of illustrations, tables and real examples which are helpful in understanding the material.Modeling and Control of Greenhouse Crop Growth will be of interest to industrial engineers, academic researchers and graduates from agricultural, chemical, and process-control backgrounds.},

	abstract = {A simulated comparison was made of five control strategies which could be used to operate greenhouse thermal screens. The energy required to produce an early tomato crop was calculated using a model of the heat loss from a greenhouse and hourly meteorological data. Reductions in yield, caused by reductions in light reaching the crop, were quantified using data from recent horticultural experiments. Using the early tomato regime temperatures, the most effective method of controlling both transparent and high performance aluminized thermal screens was to close the screen whenever the value of the energy saved exceeded the value of the crop lost because of the reduction in light. Almost as good was operating the screen at a specified value of solar irradiance, but delaying, and/or advancing, the opening and closing of the screen by a fixed time interval, was least satisfactory. The fourth method of control involved reducing the day heating setpoint temperature and increasing the night temperature, when the thermal screen was used, to achieve the same 24 h average temperature as occurred in an unscreened greenhouse. This gave greater monetary savings with no crop losses. The final control strategy was a combination of optimized control with reduced day and increased night temperatures. This was the most profitable giving net reductions in heating costs of 26 to 41\% depending on the screen and the reduction in day temperature compared to 21 to 33\% when the screens were used from sunset to sunrise.},

In this study, aspects concerning the air exchange through porous screens and openings, and heat transfer between the enclosure surface and inside air, were analysed. Basic physical laws were the starting point during the construction of the models. To illustrate the practical side of the research performed, the formulation developed was applied to the study of convective heat exchange within screened greenhouses, as well as to the study of airflow through greenhouse screens and window apertures.Concerning the airflow through porous screens and window openings, the results obtained thoroughly demonstrate the importance of inertia and viscous effects, as well as window openings' geometry effects, on fluid flow. The airflow characteristics of porous screens and the structure of fluctuation of wind velocity, were quantified.Regarding the study of free convection heat transfer within a screened greenhouse, the convective heat transfer coefficients between the air and the downward and the upward surfaces of the screen were obtained, among other results.The results obtained from this study can greatly contribute, in general, to a better climate control management of multi-zone enclosures, and specifically, to an improved application of porous screens and window apertures.},

Net photosynthesis increased significantly with increasing CO2 concentration at all light intensities, even at the lowest one. The optimal temperature for photosynthesis increased with CO2 enrichment. The changes in photosynthesis when the CO2O2 ratio was varied suggest that the effect of CO2 enrichment is a result of a reduction in photorespiration. To determine whether the increase in photosynthesis caused by CO2 enrichment would produce a greater yield, tomato plants were cultivated from seed to harvest in a tightly-closed greenhouse that was enriched with CO2 continuously during the entire growing-period. The control greenhouse was ventilated by openings in the roof and door. The temperature of the 2 greenhouses was kept the same. Plants enriched with CO2 showed a significant increase in fresh and dry weight and yield of tomatoes. The results are discussed in relation to earlier work in which CO2 enrichment was discontinued when there was a need for ventilation.},

	abstract = {In current greenhouse climate control, temperature set points follow a pre-set trajectory based on absolute or solar time parameters, adapted only to instantaneous and daily radiation. CO2 is supplied during a well defined period of the day until a maximum concentration is reached. However, the rate of CO2 supply is strongly limited by the heat demand, since flue gases are the most commonly used source of CO2. Interactions between effects of light, temperature and CO2 concentration on photosynthesis and crop growth are usually not taken into account. This study aims to make more efficient use of temperature and CO2 by developing an optimised climate control system in which temperature and CO2 are deployed such that energy use is minimised while maintaining crop production. Firstly, the diurnal temperature course resulting in a predefined daily mean value was optimised while minimising the heat demand. Most of the time, this resulted in higher day temperatures and lower night temperatures. Secondly, using the heat storage tank, the partitioning of the CO2 associated with the daily heat demand was optimised, aimed at maximised photosynthesis. Simulation results showed that in the optimised climate control system 7\% less energy was used and 2.5\% more production was realised than in a standard climate. Testing the optimised climate control in a greenhouse experiment showed that in a sweet pepper crop 6\% more energy could be conserved compared to that in the standard climate with similar production levels and fruit quality between the climate control treatments.},

With reference to a small biomass-fired steam power plant, this paper compares two implementations of a dynamic model of the plant: the first, based on a causal approach and implemented using the Matlab/Simulink software, the second, based on an a-causal object-oriented approach, implemented in the Modelica language and simulated with the Dymola program. The results of transient simulations are compared, and the merits of the two modeling approaches are discussed.},

	abstract = {With the aim of developing a model-based method to design greenhouses for a broad range of climatic and economic conditions, a tomato yield model that describes the effects of greenhouse climate on yield was described and validated. A literature survey of temperature effects on tomato yield was performed and the main temperature effects were implemented in the model. Subsequently, the yield model was validated for four temperature regimes. Results demonstrated that the tomato yield was simulated accurately for both near-optimal and non-optimal temperature conditions in the Netherlands and southern Spain, respectively, with varying light and CO2-concentrations. In addition, the adverse effects of extremely low as well as high mean temperatures on yield and timing of first fruit harvest were simulated with fair accuracy. The simulated yield response to extreme diurnal temperature oscillations were in agreement with literature values. Given these results, the model is considered to be sufficiently accurate to be used for developing a model-based greenhouse design method. Therefore, the presented model will be integrated in a model-based design method with the aim to design the best greenhouse for local climate and economic conditions.},

	abstract = {With the aim of developing a model-based method to design greenhouses for a broad range of climatic and economic conditions, a greenhouse climate model has been developed and validated. This model describes the effects of the outdoor climate and greenhouse design on the indoor greenhouse climate. For use in a greenhouse design method that focused on the optimisation of a set of design elements, the model should fulfil the following three requirements: 1) predict the temperature, vapour pressure and CO2 concentration of the greenhouse air, with sufficient accuracy for a wide variety of greenhouse designs under varying climate conditions, 2) include the commonly used greenhouse construction parameters and climate conditioning equipment, and 3) consist of a set of first order differential equations to ensure that it can be combined with a tomato yield model (of a similar structure) and to allow the use of ordinary differential equation solvers. The dynamic model was validated for four different greenhouse designs under three climatic conditions: a temperate marine climate, a Mediterranean climate and a semi-arid climate. For these conditions, the model accurately predicted the greenhouse climate for all four designs without modification of the model parameters (except for one case). In more than 78\% of the cases, comparison of simulations and measurements of the indoor climate yielded a relative root mean square error of less than 10\%. Given these results, the model is considered to be sufficiently accurate and sufficiently generic to be used for developing a model-based greenhouse design method.},
